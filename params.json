{"name":"jDrive","tagline":"Its a wrapper for Google Drive API which makes using Google Drive easy to use. ","body":"# JDrive\r\n\r\nThis wraps the Google Drive API to insert and delete files in Google Drive. This API let you use simple API like \r\n```\r\npublic File uploadFile(String fileName, String description ,String parentId);\r\n```\r\n```\r\npublic boolean deleteFile (String fileId);\r\n```\r\n```\r\npublic void uploadAllFiles(String path, String parentId) throws IOException;\r\npublic void uploadAllFilesParallel(String path, String parentId, FileFilter filter);\r\n```\r\nand removing the boiler plate code. \r\n\r\nThis API also needs secret auth key to communicate with Google Drive Server. Make sure you follow the instructions at https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/web/quickstart/java and place the file in the resources folder. A manual authentication of access will be required at the first time to validate the access. \r\n\r\nFor sanity checks you can use the test cases. Run \r\n```\r\ngradle test\r\n```\r\nThis will generate a test report at build/test/index.html .  \r\n\r\n## Test Cases \r\nIn this project jUnit test cases depends on hard coded values which are specific for the current user. I have not made it configurable yet, so if you want to use it then please go through it and fix it for yourself.  \r\n\r\n## How to build\r\nYou can download the source and go to project root directory. This project needs Grade(http://gradle.org/getting-started-gradle-java/). More help for installing gradle is provided here(https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html). \r\nFrom the command line run \r\n```\r\ngradle build\r\n```\r\nThis will compile the project and create a jar file named 'JDrive.jar' in the build/libs/ folder. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
